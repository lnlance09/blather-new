The Republicans? Or, the Democrats?\n\nMost people would probably say the Democrats. But this answer is incorrect.  \n\nSince its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights initiative, and has a long history of discrimination. \n\nThe Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed Reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynchings, and fought against the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nIn contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territories with the aim of abolishing it entirely. This effort, however, was dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court. In the 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, the court ruled that slaves aren’t citizens; they’re property. The seven justices who voted in favor of slavery? All Democrats. The two justices who dissented? Both Republicans.\n\nThe slavery question was, of course, ultimately resolved by a bloody civil war. The commander-in-chief during that war was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln – the man who freed the slaves. \n\nSix days after the Confederate army surrendered, John Wilkes Booth, a Democrat, assassinated President Lincoln. Lincoln’s vice president, a Democrat named Andrew Johnson, assumed the presidency. But Johnson adamantly opposed Lincoln’s plan to integrate the newly freed slaves into the South’s economic and social order. \n\nJohnson and the Democratic Party were unified in their opposition to the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which gave blacks citizenship; and the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the vote. All three passed only because of universal Republican support.\n\nDuring the era of Reconstruction, federal troops stationed in the south helped secure rights for the newly freed slaves. Hundreds of black men were elected to southern state legislatures as Republicans, and 22 black Republicans served in the US Congress by 1900. The Democrats did not elect a black man to Congress until 1935.\n\nBut after Reconstruction ended, when the federal troops went home, Democrats roared back into power in the South. They quickly reestablished white supremacy across the region with measures like black codes – laws that restricted the ability of blacks to own property and run businesses. And they imposed poll taxes and literacy tests, used to subvert the black citizen’s right to vote.\n\nAnd how was all of this enforced? By terror -- much of it instigated by the Ku Klux Klan, founded by a Democrat, Nathan Bedford Forrest. \n\nAs historian Eric Foner - himself a Democrat - notes:\n\n“In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.”\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/inconvenient-truth-about-democratic-party',NULL,8667257,NULL,NULL,'2017-05-22 00:00:00','g_a7dQXilCo','youtube_videos/g_a7dQXilCo.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:50','2021-09-28 03:09:50'),

Doesn’t “neutral” mean that no one is picking winners and losers, that everyone is equal? \n\nMaybe according to the dictionary, but not according to the people behind the Net Neutrality movement. For them, \"neutral\" means the government regulates the internet like a public utility—and that means bureaucrats making key decisions about how the internet is run.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what happened in 2015. \n\nThe Federal Communications Commission—or FCC—under the Obama Administration, came up with Net Neutrality rules and regulations and imposed them on consumers. No open hearings—they just did it. \n\nHere’s what they said: Internet Service Providers, or ISPs—AT&T, Verizon, and other companies that lay the cable that goes to your house—are basically monopolies like your typical utility company. To prevent abuse of this position, Net Neutrality rules prohibited them from charging websites different prices no matter how much or how little bandwidth they use. \n\nBut this is exactly the opposite of what utilities are allowed to do. Electricity providers, for instance, are allowed to create pricing tiers—the more you use, the higher the price goes. If you use significantly more power than your neighbor, you pay more for the privilege. \n\n“Net Neutrality” forces ISPs to charge all users the same price no matter how much data they send through the internet. \n\nIt’s a bad idea. Here’s why: \n\nThe internet consists of a physical infrastructure consisting of cable and phone lines that carry the data—we call it \"bandwidth.\" But of course, there’s a limit to how much data it can carry. In 2014, just two companies, Netflix and Google (which owns YouTube), consumed more than 52% of the total bandwidth of the entire internet. All those data-heavy movies and videos clog up the “pipe.”\n\nTo combat this massive resource drain, the ISPs floated the idea of creating “fast lanes”: bandwidth that would be dedicated to the big users in exchange for higher usage rates. You use more, you pay more. Believe me, I’m no fan of ISPs, but shouldn\'t they be allowed to charge companies more if they use more bandwidth?\n\nFurthermore, if companies like Google and Netflix have to pay higher prices for more bandwidth, they’ll be motivated to find new ways to push more data through the “pipe.” And creative startups would no doubt see a great business opportunity to do the same thing. \n\nEnd result: More efficient, faster internet. Consumers win.\n\nThe big bandwidth users didn’t see it this way. Instead, they lobbied for the new rules to prevent the ISPs from charging them differently than anyone else. Naturally, they want to pay as little as they can for bandwidth. So, they mounted a big PR campaign to convince the public to back the new regulations. And it worked.

Because, let’s be fair: We play an important role in your delusion. We camp out for days to buy tickets to your sold-out shows, then shout for you to reach down from the stage to touch our hands.\n\nFaster than science would believe humanly possible, we learn the lyrics to your every song and master the choreography to your every dance move. We devour your movies, TV shows, and Netflix specials.\n\nFrom that angle, I suppose it’s easy to believe that after all the adulation, all the fan mail and all the magazine covers, you may have actually come to believe that we care what you think.\n\nBut you’re wrong. Nobody cares what you think.\n\nNobody!\n\nWell, maybe your mother and your therapist do. But we don’t—not even a little. Allow me to spell this one out for you.\n\nI go to a Lady Gaga concert to hear her belt out tunes that remind me of my messy college days. But watching her desperate protest against the results of a free and fair election? Hardly an event I’d ever care to see again in my lifetime.\n\nI follow Beyoncé because—let’s face it—nobody does a break-up anthem better. But can someone please tell me why I should care if she’s for Hillary… or for Garfield the Cat?\n\nAnd here’s to you, Marc Jacobs—you design a killer pair of shoes. But as a political philosopher you leave a lot to be desired. In fact, it’s difficult to comprehend why you thought it necessary to publicly refuse to dress our first lady. \n\nAnd to the scores of celebrities who threaten to move out of the country if we don’t vote your way—wow! Just how long on a private jet must one travel to reach that level of narcissism?\n\nThis may rock your glittery world, but we don’t care whether you stay in America or move to another country. Why would we care where you live?\n\nOn the one hand, we should find all of this amusing; but on the other, it’s actually deeply offensive: It’s offensive that you confuse our admiration for blind faith. When Eminem raps I have to either pick him or the president of the United States, I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/dear-celebrities-no-one-cares-what-you-think',NULL,2151757,NULL,NULL,'2018-03-05 00:00:00','oQQQNx3qthE','youtube_videos/oQQQNx3qthE.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:50','2021-09-28 03:09:50'),

How can you make an atheist believe in god? Can you convert an atheist? Well, if you\'re a theist, the answers to those questions might disappoint you. Theists often don\'t understand atheism in the first place, and even when they do, they often use faulty arguments to prove god\'s existence. When I came out as an atheist, I was bombarded by bad arguments for god, and that still hasn\'t changed much. So, I thought I\'d give theists some advice on how to talk to atheists.\n\nIt strikes me how so many \"My conversion from atheist to Christian\" type stories involve emotional reasoning. The Kalam cosmological argument, Paschal\'s wager, the ontological argument, the argument for design, and the like don\'t seem to convince many atheists, and those with decent critical thinking skills don\'t seem to convert.\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/zkdMd5E\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA',NULL,165700,9466,343,'2018-10-29 17:00:00','2epOiiJ0ayk','youtube_videos/2epOiiJ0ayk.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:51','2021-09-28 03:09:51'),

The United States elects a president who says he’ll put “America First.”\n\nAround the world, nationalism is winning elections. Many see this nationalist revival as the great danger of our time, fearing that nationalism will take us back to a more primitive and racist past.\n\nBut it wasn’t long ago that great political figures such as Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt, David Ben-Gurion and Mahatma Gandhi, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher recognized what I call the virtue of nationalism.\n\nSo, what is this virtue? \n\nA nationalist believes that the world is governed best when nations are free to chart their own independent course, cultivating their traditions and pursuing their interests without interference. Nationalism is not about racism. All nations are internally diverse. And it isn’t about isolationism. \n\nOf course, nations can a pursue a variety of different policies in diplomacy and trade. Nationalism is the opposite of imperialism—or globalism or transnationalism—which are all names for the attempt to bring peace and prosperity to the world by uniting mankind under a single political authority.\n\nThe debate between nationalists and globalists, then, is over whether we should aspire to a world of many independent nations—or to be one unified super-state, like the enlightened “Federation” of the Star Trek movies. A case can be made for both sides of the argument. But for the last 30 years—really, since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Soviet Union—the “one world“ side has been dominant.\n\nToday, this is changing. Maybe not among elites, but among ordinary citizens—or, as they are known in America, “the deplorables.” It turns out that a lot of people still think good borders make good neighbors.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that people want to preserve the way of life they and their ancestors built up over centuries, the way of life they believe is best. It’s human nature. Our strongest loyalties are to those who are closest to us: to our family; then the larger community or “tribe”, and finally, to the nation. \n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/why-you-should-be-nationalist',NULL,1856596,NULL,NULL,'2018-12-17 00:00:00','BfJ25LXtLTg','youtube_videos/BfJ25LXtLTg.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:51','2021-09-28 03:09:51'),

Every Republican president—for that matter, virtually every Republican—since the 1970s has been called a fascist; now, more than ever.\n\nThis label is based on the idea that fascism is a phenomenon of the political right. The left says it is, and some self-styled white supremacists and neo-Nazis embrace the label. \n\nBut are they correct?\n\nTo answer this question, we have to ask what fascism really means: What is its underlying ideology? Where does it even come from?\n\nThese are not easy questions to answer. We know the name of the philosopher of capitalism: Adam Smith. We know the name of the philosopher of Marxism: Karl Marx. But who’s the philosopher of fascism? \n\nYes—exactly. You don’t know. Don’t feel bad. Almost no one knows. This is not because he doesn’t exist, but because historians, most of whom are on the political left, had to erase him from history in order to avoid confronting fascism’s actual beliefs. So, let me introduce him to you. His name is Giovanni Gentile. \n\nBorn in 1875, he was one of the world’s most influential philosophers in the first half of the twentieth century. Gentile believed that there were two “diametrically opposed” types of democracy. One is liberal democracy, such as that of the United States, which Gentile dismisses as individualistic—too centered on liberty and personal rights—and therefore selfish. The other, the one Gentile recommends, is “true democracy,” in which individuals willingly subordinate themselves to the state.\n\nLike his philosophical mentor, Karl Marx, Gentile wanted to create a community that resembles the family, a community where we are “all in this together.” It’s easy to see the attraction of this idea. Indeed, it remains a common rhetorical theme of the left.\n\nFor example, at the 1984 convention of the Democratic Party, the governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, likened America to an extended family where, through the government, people all take care of each other. \n\nNothing’s changed. Thirty years later, a slogan of the 2012 Democratic Party convention was, “The government is the only thing we all belong to.” They might as well have been quoting Gentile.\n\nNow, remember, Gentile was a man of the left. He was a committed socialist. For Gentile, fascism is a form of socialism—indeed, its most workable form. While the socialism of Marx mobilizes people on the basis of class, fascism mobilizes people by appealing to their national identity as well as their class. Fascists are socialists with a national identity. German Fascists in the 1930s were called Nazis—basically a contraction of the term “national socialist.”\n \nFor Gentile, all private action should be oriented to serve society; there is no distinction between the private interest and the public interest. Correctly understood, the two are identical. And who is the administrative arm of the society? It’s none other than the state. Consequently, to submit to society is to submit to the state—not just in economic matters, but in all matters. Since everything is political, the state gets to tell everyone how to think and what to do. \n\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/fascism-right-or-left',NULL,2050451,NULL,NULL,'2017-12-04 00:00:00','m6bSsaVL6gA','youtube_videos/m6bSsaVL6gA.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:51','2021-09-28 03:09:51'),

Denmark is the model to follow. \n\nThere’s just one problem. It’s a fantasy.\n\nFor it to be true, Denmark would have to be a socialist country. But it’s not. If it were, it would have gone “Venezuela” a long time ago. Sorry to bring all the new fans of socialism the bad news. But that’s the reality.\n\nYes, it’s true that Denmark has high taxes and a high level of government spending—key features of a socialist mentality. But in almost every other respect, Denmark is a full-on free market capitalist country.\n\nAnd it has some of the strongest protections of individual property rights in the world.\n\nAnd it’s a particularly easy place to open a business. According to the World Bank, there is less bureaucratic red tape in Denmark than in any other country, except for New Zealand and Singapore.\n\nAnd the labor market is less regulated than in most countries. Here’s something you probably didn’t know: there are no minimum wage laws in Denmark.\n\nIt’s not surprising then—or maybe it is surprising, given all the misinformation out there—that Denmark ranks consistently as one of the top-ranked free market economies in the world by The Fraser Institute in Canada and The Heritage Foundation.\n\nSo, if Denmark is not a socialist country, what is it?\n\nThe answer is pretty straightforward: it’s a small capitalist country (about the size and population of Maryland) whose citizens pay oodles in taxes in exchange for oodles in benefits. \n\nWell, what’s wrong with that? you might ask.\n\nOnly this: for the government to pay out such benefits, you need citizens to make enough money to pay the necessary taxes.\n\nAnd that’s only possible through a free market economy. \n\nLet me explain—with some Danish history.\n\nDenmark, like its Scandinavian neighbors, Sweden and Norway, made a remarkable economic recovery after the Second World War. The combination of a highly productive work force and—get this—low taxes created a lot of wealth.\n\nSo like every other wealthy welfare state, Denmark became wealthy before it created the welfare state.\n\nRelative to Europe, Denmark’s economic high-water mark was in the 1950s; relative to the US, it was the early ‘70s. It was then, in the late ’60s and early ’70s, that the country’s ruling elite became preoccupied with wealth redistribution. But the price paid for this social experiment was steep and swift.  \n\nThe expansion of public spending led to a severe economic crisis. The national debt skyrocketed. It took decades of consolidation, structural reforms and curtailing of welfare schemes to straighten out this mess.\n\nThis is the stuff you never hear about from the “Danish model” crowd.\n\nThe sharp tax hikes and spending also sparked a widespread popular revolt and led to the emergence of the “tax protestors” party, Fremskridtspartiet. Even though the party no longer exists, the widespread desire to cut taxes remains. \n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/video/is-denmark-socialist',NULL,65808,8047,187,'2019-04-22 08:57:02','tzEPKrHalaY','youtube_videos/tzEPKrHalaY.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:52','2021-09-28 03:09:52'),

It’s not the same as socialism socialism, because it’s democratic. Right? Or something, right? People are buying that; people buy that now, right? Apparently. As though adding the word “democratic” in front of a word changes what it means. Just because we toss something to a vote doesn’t change what that something is, nor does it alter whether that something is inherently good or bad. \n\nA couple of examples, because I know you’ll ask: Hamas was democratically elected as the government in Gaza – despite the fact that the destruction of not only Israel, but the eradication of all Jews, is in their official charter. Robert Mugabe, or Bobby Mugabe if you prefer, was democratically elected by a loving majority in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe! How’s that working out?\n\nVenezuela? Well, Hugo Chavez, noted personal favorite friend of Sean Penn, to whom he constantly pointed as being unfairly characterized as a dictator when, in fact, he was democratically elected as a socialist.\n\nWell, how’d that workout for Venezuela? Well, it’s now on the brink of collapse despite it being one of the most resource rich nations in the entire world. Basic things like eggs, milk, flour, and toilet paper are either too expensive for the average Venezuelan or simply out of stock… out of stock, mind you... democratically. I know, some of you will say, “Well that’s not fair, because really we knew all along it technically was a dictatorship.” Ok – that’s fair; let’s move on to example number two.\n\nDenmark? Ok, here’s the time where you point to an entirely homogenous population about one sixtieth the size of America’s, and you point to that as the blueprint? Ok – let’s go there. This is a place where the middle class can’t even afford a car because of the 180% new-car tax. And the Prime Minister was so fed up with Americans pointing to it as a beacon for socialist success that he felt compelled to clarify, “I would like to make one thing clear: Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy; Denmark is a market economy.”\n\nSweden? I love Sweden! Ok, great bikini team, and thanks to that country my armoire now doubles as a bookcase. Speaking of which, the founder of IKEA – let’s be honest, the only real cool export from Sweden aside from a few good hockey players – left Sweden because of the stifling high tax rate. So, Sweden – good place, not bad people – but a successful model for a viable economy in today’s global market?

We can sum up each economic system in one line: \n\nCapitalism is based on human greed.  Socialism is based on human need. \n\nRight? \n\nNo. Wrong. \n\nSo wrong, it’s exactly backwards. And I’ll prove it to you. \n\nBeen on Amazon lately? Each of the thousands of products Amazon offers represents the work of people who believe they have something you want or need. If they’re right, they prosper. If they’re wrong, they don’t. \n\nThat’s how the free market works. It encourages people to improve their lives by satisfying the needs of others. No one starts a business making a thing or providing a service for themselves. They start a business to make things or provide services for others. \n\nI speak from personal experience. \n\nWhen I was the CEO of the company that owns Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurant chains, we spent millions of dollars every year trying to determine what customers wanted. If our customers didn’t like something, we changed it—and fast, because if we didn’t, our competitors would (pun intended) eat us for lunch.\n\nThe consumer—that’s you—has the ultimate power. In effect, you vote with every dollar you spend. \n\nIn a socialist economy, the government has the ultimate power. It decides what you get from a limited supply it decides should exist. \n\nInstead of millions of people making millions of decisions about what they want, a few people—government elites—decide what people should have and how much they should pay for it. Not surprisingly, they always get it wrong. Have you ever noticed that late-stage socialist failures always run out of essential items like toilet paper? \n\nOf course, this isn’t a problem for those who have the right connections with the right people. Those chosen few get whatever they want. But everyone else is out of luck.  \n\nVenezuela, once the richest country in South America, is the most recent example of socialism driving a prosperous country into an economic ditch.  Maybe you think it’s an unfair example. I’m not sure why, but okay. We’ll ignore the fact that leftist activists celebrated it as a great socialist success—right up until it wasn’t.\n\nBut what about Western European countries? Don\'t they have socialist economies? People seem pretty happy there. Why can’t we have what they have—free health care, free college, stronger unions?\n\nGood question. And the answer may surprise you. \n\nThere are no socialist countries in Western Europe. Most are just as capitalist as the United States. The only difference—and it’s a big one—is that they offer more government benefits than the U.S. does. \n\nWe can argue about the costs of these benefits and the point at which they reduce individual initiative, thus doing more harm than good. Scandinavians have been debating those questions for years. But only a free-market capitalist economy can produce the wealth necessary to sustain all of the supposedly “free stuff” Europeans enjoy. To get the “free stuff,” after all, you have to create enough wealth to generate enough tax revenue to pay for everything the government gives away. \n\nWithout capitalism, you’re Venezuela.\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/video/capitalism-vs-socialism',NULL,3539665,30112,2067,'2019-03-04 10:00:03','Fdfru9NHGvE','youtube_videos/Fdfru9NHGvE.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:52','2021-09-28 03:09:52'),

This one is much more valuable. There are entire organizations that have been built upon it. And individuals that have used it to acquire both wealth and influence.\n\nIf this sounds like something you might wish to own, you should know that there is only one way you can get your hands on it: you have to be born with black skin.\n\nThat’s the only requirement. Really. \n\nYou can be poor, middle class, or rich—it doesn\'t matter. The black card will still confer upon you an entire history of oppression, even if you’ve never been oppressed.\n\nFlash the black card, and most white people will cower.\n\nPlay the black card expertly, and you can win awards, make millions—all the while claiming that the people who got you there somehow hate you. \n\nWith a black card, you can sell books full of indecipherable prose. Because with a card that powerful, who cares if your words make any sense?\n\nYou can call yourself a “civil rights leader” and shake down multinational corporations, or you can torch your own neighborhood because you didn’t like the outcome of a grand jury verdict.\n\nIronically, the people you might think have the most legitimate claim to the black card refuse to use it.\n\nTake my grandfather, for instance:\n\nHe raised me from the time I was 9 years old. Born in 1941 in rural North Carolina, he started working at age five, laying out tobacco to dry on a sharecropping farm. Jim Crow, separate drinking fountains, and the KKK were ever-present realities.\n\nHe was 17 when he married my grandmother. He made a living cleaning homes and office buildings until he saved up enough money to open his own cleaning business.\n\nThe thing is, he never played any card. Nor did my grandmother. If they had problems, they didn’t blame anybody. They just fixed them.\n\nAnd they raised me to do the same.\n\nChores were a requirement in their household. So was reading the Bible every morning before school.\n\nI didn’t like the Bible readings, and I hated the chores. But I realize now that these small acts of discipline, although sometimes stifling, had a strong, positive impact on my character. \n\nI was a first-generation college student. This was supposed to be the ticket to prosperity. But it wasn’t. I left college with a mountain of debt and no practical skills. I had just $80 dollars in my bank account and very few prospects. I could have given up. I could have dug deep into my history and declared myself a natural product of ancestral oppression. I could have played the black card and absolved myself of all responsibility for my own stupid decisions.\n\nExcept, I didn’t. Because it would have destroyed my grandfather’s legacy.\n\nI am proud that he had the fortitude to turn nothing into something; and I have no intention of reversing that something back into a nothing.\n\nMy attitude comes with a price, however. Because if you are born black and you don’t accept your natural status as a victim, then the validity of your blackness is immediately called into question.\n\nWell, so be it.\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/playing-black-card',NULL,5369087,46284,4092,'2018-05-21 07:56:29','qKpEl9jJ4dA','youtube_videos/qKpEl9jJ4dA.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:52','2021-09-28 03:09:52'),

The answer in terms of sheer numbers and sheer horror might surprise you.   It\'s Christians, specifically Christians living in Muslim-majority countries, countries where Christians often preceded Muslims by centuries.  I\'m not talking about \"War on Christmas\" type harassment; I\'m talking about \"know your place or we\'re going to kill you\" persecution. Astonishingly, the Western mainstream media barely acknowledge what is happening. \n \nLet\'s look closer at this issue. It tells us a lot about the world we\'re living in. \n\nOne hundred years ago, 20% of North Africa and the Middle East, the birthplace of Christianity, was Christian. Today, Christians make up 4% of the population. Much of that decline has occurred in the last decade.  In essence Muslims are rendering North Africa and the Middle East free of Christians. \n\nTake Egypt, for example, my ancestral homeland. In just the past two years, tens of thousands of Christian Copts have left Egypt. And many others want to leave, but they simply cannot afford to.  Why they want to leave is no mystery. \n\nOn New Year\'s Day 2011, the Two Saints Church in Alexandria was bombed, leaving 23 Copts dead and 97 injured.  In recent years dozens of Coptic churches have been attacked, many burned to the ground.  In August 2013 alone, the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters attacked and destroyed some 80 churches.\n\nUnfortunately, Egypt is more the rule than the exception. \n\nHundreds of Nigerian churches have been destroyed in recent years, with especially deadly attacks reserved for Christmas and Easter church services, leaving dozens dead or mutilated. Churches have been bombed or burned in Iraq, Syria, and just about every place in the Middle East where churches still exist except Israel.  Christian businesses have been torched, Christian girls have been kidnapped, sold as child brides or slaves, and had acid thrown in their faces for not being veiled. Anyone born a Muslim who converts to Christianity faces jail and possibly execution. The list of fresh atrocities by Muslims against Christians grows longer almost every day.  Even in Muslim countries often portrayed as \"moderate\" -- Morocco, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan -- Christian minorities are under legal pressure not to build churches or evangelize. \n\nThe Christians in these Muslim countries are often identical to their co-citizens in race, ethnicity, national identity, culture, and language; there is no political dispute between the Christians and Muslims, no land dispute. Vastly outnumbered and politically marginalized, these Christians simply wish to worship in peace. Instead they are hounded and attacked.\n\nSo, then, why is this happening? And why is the media making so little mention of it?  \n\nThe first question is easy to answer. Christians are being persecuted in Muslim countries because they\'re Christians, or as the Quran puts it, \"infidels,\" that is, non-Muslims, who are regarded by many fundamentalist Muslims as inferior.  As a fundamentalist interpretation of the holy books of Islam has grown in the last fifty or so years, Christians have suffered. And in recent years, they have suffered terribly. I document this in my book, Crucified Again: Exposing Islam\'s New War on Christians.\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/worlds-most-persecuted-minority-christians',NULL,1470588,41569,6483,'2014-11-10 10:15:59','ytdMUddGe-U','youtube_videos/ytdMUddGe-U.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:52','2021-09-28 03:09:52'),

You might think you’re a progressive. I used to think I was. My show, “The Rubin Report,” was originally part of the progressive “Young Turks” network.\n\nProgressives struck me as liberals, but louder. Progressives were the nice guys; they looked out for the little guy; they cared about women and minorities; they embraced change.\n\nIn short, who wouldn’t want to be a progressive?\n\nBut over the last couple years, the meaning of the word “progressive” has changed. \n\nProgressives used to say, “I may disagree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.” Not anymore.\n \nBanning speakers whose opinions you don’t agree with from college campuses – that’s not progressive. Prohibiting any words not approved of as “politically correct” – that’s not progressive. Putting “Trigger Warnings” on books, movies, music, anything that might offend people – that’s not progressive either. \n\nAll of this has led me to be believe that much of the left is no longer progressive, but regressive. This is one of the reasons I’ve spent so much time on my show talking about The Regressive Left.  \n\nThis regressive ideology doesn’t judge people as individuals, but as a collective. \n\nIf you’re black, or female, or Muslim, or Hispanic, or a member of any other minority group, you’re judged differently than the most evil of all things: a white, Christian male. The Regressive Left ranks minority groups in a pecking order to compete in a kind of “Oppression Olympics”. Gold medal goes to the most offended. \n\nMartin Luther King, Jr.’s dream that his children would be judged by their character and not their skin color was a liberal idea, but these days, it’s not a progressive ideal. \n\nAnd what about religious freedom - the idea that no one else can tell you what you have to believe? Surely progressives still support that basic right. \n\nWell, not so much.\n\nI’m a married gay man, so you might think that I appreciate the government forcing a Christian baker or photographer or florist to act against their religion in order to cater, photograph or decorate my wedding. But you’d be wrong. A government that can force Christians to violate their conscience can force me to violate mine. If a baker won’t bake you a cake, find another baker; don’t demand that the state tell him what to do with his private business. \n\nI’m pro-choice. But a government that can force a group of Catholic nuns - literally called the Little Sisters of the Poor - to violate their faith and pay for abortion-inducing birth control can force anyone to do anything. \n\nThat’s not progressive; that’s regressive!\n\nToday\'s progressivism has become a faux-moral movement, hurling charges of racism, bigotry, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and a slew of other meaningless buzzwords at anyone they disagree with. \n\nThe battle of ideas has been replaced by a battle of feelings, and outrage has replaced honesty. Diversity reigns supreme – as long as it’s not that pesky diversity of thought.\n\nThis isn’t the recipe for a free society, it’s a recipe for authoritarianism.\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/why-i-left-left',NULL,14210729,NULL,NULL,'2017-02-06 00:00:00','hiVQ8vrGA_8','youtube_videos/hiVQ8vrGA_8.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:53','2021-09-28 03:09:53'),

A Democrat recently said that anyone making fun of congresswoman should be prosecuted and that they will \'shut them down.\'\n\nThis is just another statement in a long line of authoritarian demands made by far left Democrats. From AOC saying she\'s the boss and youre in the cheap seats, Velazquez saying \"youre right to be afraid of us\" or Elizabeth Warren calling big tech to censor people we are seeing Democrats make ever more authoritarian demands.\n\nThe Far left has adopted \'social justice\' as a shield to gain power. In the end they seem to only care about themselves and not principles. They aren\'t actually fighting for social justice, they are fighting for personal gain.\n\nThe Situation with Andy Ngo is the best example. They rush to defend what happened to him and few on the left condemn it. Even mainstream journalists are excusing what happened and some even encourage it.\n\n#FarLeft\n#Democrats\n#Censorship\n\nSUPPORT JOURNALISM.

AOC recently endorsed a primary challenger to a sitting House Democrat which is what we all expected based on her past statements. But you\'d think the Democrats would rally behind those most likely to win reelection.\n\nAOC has protested Nancy Pelosi and repeatedly obstructed Democrats plans, even voting in line with republicans in some instances, though for different reasons.\n\nThe far left Democrats plan is to \"shred the establishment\" and to attack it to its core, at least that how TYT host Cenk Uygur described it in 2016.\n\nModerate and centrist Democrats did the best in 2018, yet they seem to think they can work with the far left in good faith. Kyrsten Sinema is currently under threat of censure for only voting against Trump 81% of the time. Apparently overwhelmingly supporting Democrats is not enough, they want total submission.\n\nThe result won\'t be what the far left thinks. Moderates stand the best chance of winning but if the far left democrats disrupt and sabotage incumbent Democrats then they will only weaken their party. Republicans and Trump will keep winning while the left is busy dealing with the far left.\n\n#AOC\n#FarLeft\n#Democrats\n\nSUPPORT JOURNALISM.

I don’t care how much companies pollute rivers and streams. I don’t even like trees. I just care about tax cuts.  \n\nWho am I? Well, that’s easy: I’m a conservative. Or at least, I’m a progressive caricature of a conservative. \nBut the caricature is absurd on its face. Conservatives breathe the same air and drink the same water environmentalists do. Conservatives love taking their kids to the same national parks environmentalists do.\n\nIn fact, the whole idea of national parks was created by a Republican, Ulysses Grant. The park system was greatly expanded by another Republican, Teddy Roosevelt. And the Environmental Protection Agency was, yes, established by a Republican—Richard Nixon. He liked clean air, too. \n\nConservatives want to conserve things. It’s right there in the name. And one of the things we want to conserve is our environment, because you can’t have a healthy community without a healthy natural environment. That wasn’t even hard for me to say. Because…I believe it. \n\nConservatives love the environment every bit as much as environmentalists do. The question is: What is the best way to protect it? And here’s where we have big differences. \n\nThe environmentalists say the best way—the only way—is through massive federal, and even international, regulation. Conservatives say the best way to protect the environment is by protecting property rights and encouraging innovation. Safer, more efficient power—nuclear, geothermal, biomass—anything that generates energy at a price consumers want and can afford to pay. \n\nTo the extent that government gets involved in conservation—say, protecting wildlife—it should get involved at the most local level possible, since the farmer, forester or fisherman in Oregon knows a lot more about his environment than some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C. or Brussels.\n\nSo how can we tell which way works best? \n\nLet’s examine the historical record. Today and for the last century, the worst environmental offenders have been big, repressive, socialist governments. This was true in the last century, and it’s true now. \n\nChina, for example, pumps roughly twice as much carbon into the air each year as the United States, even though the U.S. economy is almost 60% larger than China’s. \n\nAnd how do those international agreements fare at protecting the environment? Not too well, it turns out. \n\nWhen President Trump announced his intention to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord, environmentalists warned of imminent disaster. Yet a year later, it turned out that the United States led the world in reducing carbon emissions. It did so without surrendering its national sovereignty. \n\nMoreover, Canada, the EU, and China—all signatories to the Paris Accords—not only failed to live up to their commitments, but increased their annual carbon emissions. The EU released an additional 40 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air that year; China, a whopping 120 million additional tons—all while wagging their fingers at Uncle Sam. \n\nHere’s what you won’t hear from your neighborhood Greenpeace volunteer: The left favors Big Government solutions not because it’s better for the environment, but because it’s better for leftism. \n\nTake a look at the Green New Deal, an environmental proposal embraced by virtually every major progressive in America. Forget for a moment the impracticality of a plan that would outlaw most forms of American energy and cost $93 trillion dollars. Much of the proposal has nothing to do with the environment: socialized medicine, reparations for historical wrongs, and a jobs-guarantee program are just a few of the items on its wish list. \n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/video/conservatives-are-the-real-environmentalists',NULL,2459097,NULL,NULL,'2020-03-30 00:00:00','RfECzdHM-Mg','youtube_videos/RfECzdHM-Mg.mp4','2021-09-28 03:09:54','2021-09-28 03:09:54'),
